### Requirements to Start Application

### Vue
After working with other frameworks such as Angular , I've chosen VueJS because it's a framework that leads you to improve the structure of your code, it has a community that makes it better every day and because of the flexibility it has when changing the theme of the project.

Below I show you the packages I developed the application with:

- Vue cli (v4.5.0)
- HTTP client: Axios
- Unit testing: Jest
- Routes management: VueRouter
- Store management: Vuex
